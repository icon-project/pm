Project Management - all core dev meeting agenda and minutes

### Agenda Items
Agenda's are posted to https://github.com/icon-project/pm/issues. Anyone is welcome to add an item to the agenda as long as it follows these guidelines:

- The topic is technical in nature.
- The topic involves the ICON protocol at a low-level. This means DApps and IRCs are generally not allowed as topics.
- The topic should not be philosophical. The core developer meetings are not meant to decide philosophical contentious issues that should be decided by the community. There are exceptions to this, but generally these topics distract from more productive technical discussion.
